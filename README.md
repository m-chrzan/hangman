# Hangman

Hangman for the command-line interface.

Run `./game.rb` to start playing.

During gameplay you can save the current gamestate by entering "SAVE" instead of
a guess. You will be prompted for a file name, and the game will be saved in the
`saves/` directory. This will exit the game.

When starting the game again, you can load the file and pick up where you left 
off.
